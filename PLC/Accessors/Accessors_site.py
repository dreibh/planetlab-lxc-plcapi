# Accessors_site.py is the place where you can define your own local tag accessors
# this will not be overwritten through rpm upgrades
#
# Historical note: now that Sites are taggable too, the name may be confusing, 
# think of this as Accessors_local.py
#
# to ensure creation of new tag_types, just run 
#   service plc start accessors
# also for the running API to take the new accessors into account, you need to
#   apachectl restart
# or to stay on the safe side, simply do
#   service plc restart
#
# methods denotes the set of methods (names) that get inserted into the API
# it is updated by define_accessors
